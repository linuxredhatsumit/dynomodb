Improve Deployment Automation & Service Onboarding

Designed and implemented fully automated DynamoDB pipelines for table creation, GSI management, capacity mode switching, and auto-scaling policies, reducing provisioning time from hours to <10 minutes across all environments.
Built reusable end-to-end onboarding pipelines for new microservices and EKS clusters (ECR promotion, Helm packaging, VirtualService, secret injection, cross-account deployment), enabling zero-touch onboarding of 20+ services including Motor-Insurance, VerifyPlus, and Re-KYC.
Standardized cluster and gateway onboarding via pipeline templates, eliminating manual console operations and ensuring consistent, auditable deployments.

Lead Domain Migration to bank.in

Spearheaded complete migration of kotak811.com to kotak811.bank.in for 20+ public-facing services, orchestrating SAN certificate creation/import, ACM updates, CloudFront/ALB certificate replacement, CORS changes, CNAME cutover, and header updates with zero customer impact and full regulatory compliance.

Enhance System Reliability & Production Delivery

Executed 100+ zero-downtime production deployments (CMR/ECMR) for critical services (Auth & User, Transaction, Reward-Journey, IIP, Acqui, BRE, Charging, Nudge, VerifyPlus, etc.) while serving as primary DevOps on-call engineer.
Resolved multiple emergency incidents including memory leak fixes, AWS key switch-overs, and hotfixes, minimizing downtime and maintaining 99.99%+ service availability.

Strengthen Security & Compliance

Led periodic IAM access key and SES key rotation/switch-over across prod and non-prod environments, eliminating static credentials and reducing attack surface.
Managed full SSL/TLS certificate lifecycle (creation, renewal, ACM import, CloudFront/ALB binding) for 15+ domains and proactively deactivated legacy keys following least-privilege principles.

Optimize Observability & Cost Efficiency

Drove logging optimization across high-volume services (Auth & User, Transaction, Reward-Journey, Nudge), removing unnecessary warnings and implementing structured parsing, reducing log volume by 60%+ and significantly lowering CloudWatch costs.
