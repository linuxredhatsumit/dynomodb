Step-by-Step: DNS Resolution & Certificate Validation Process
1Ô∏è‚É£ DNS Resolution Check

Goal: Determine whether the domain is public or internal.

How to Check:

Go to: https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx

Select DNS Lookup (A Record)
Example:
811insurance.kotak811.com

Interpretation:

‚úÖ If you see a public IP or DNS record ‚Üí It‚Äôs a Public Domain.

‚ùå If there‚Äôs no DNS record found ‚Üí It‚Äôs likely Internal / Private DNS.

2Ô∏è‚É£ If the Domain is Internal
Next Steps:

Check the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

Go to AWS Console ‚Üí Certificate Manager (ACM)

Look for certificates related to 811insurance.kotak811.com

Review Associated Resources (generally you‚Äôll see ~5 entries)

Verify which services or load balancers are using the certificate.

Check the ‚ÄúAssignment‚Äù

Identify whether the certificate is attached to:

ALB (Application Load Balancer)

NLB (Network Load Balancer)

CloudFront, or

API Gateway

Open a Jira Ticket

Title: Certificate Renewal for Internal Domain

Add details:

Domain name(s)

Environment (Dev/UAT/Prod)

Expiration date

Associated AWS resources

Next action (CSR creation, renewal, or validation)

Create both CSRs (Certificate Signing Requests):

For internal domains:

811insurance.kotak811.com

811insurance.kotak811.bank.in

Use OpenSSL or ACM (depending on internal policy)

Notify Dev / TPM Teams

Check with development or TPM (Technical Project Manager) teams:

Who needs to be informed?

Who owns the service behind these domains?

3Ô∏è‚É£ If the Domain is Public
Next Steps:

Check DNS Configuration

Use MXToolbox or dig/nslookup:

dig 811insurance.kotak811.com


Identify if DNS is managed by Cloudflare or another provider.

Check in Cloudflare Dashboard

Login to Cloudflare

Open the domain (kotak811.com)

Go to SSL/TLS ‚Üí Overview

Identify Certificate Type:

üîπ Universal SSL:

Cloudflare automatically manages and renews the SSL certificate.

No manual action needed.

üîπ Custom SSL:

You have uploaded a custom certificate manually.

You must manage renewal manually:

Check ACM or wherever cert was generated.

Renew certificate before expiry.

Re-upload updated certificate to Cloudflare.
