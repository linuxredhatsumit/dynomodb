What are Secure Mount Options (nodev, nosuid, noexec)?

These are filesystem-level security options that control what users and processes can do with files in certain mounted directories. They're recommended by CIS Benchmarks for hardening your Linux system.

âœ… Here's what each one does:
Option	Description
nodev	Prevents use of device files (like /dev/sda) on the mounted filesystem
nosuid	Blocks execution of files with SUID/SGID bits, which can escalate privileges
noexec	Prevents execution of binaries from this mount (scripts may still run)
ðŸ“Œ Typical Mount Points to Harden

These options are commonly applied to non-essential filesystems:

Mount Point	Recommended Options
/tmp	nodev,nosuid,noexec
/var/tmp	nodev,nosuid,noexec
/home	nodev
/dev/shm	nodev,nosuid,noexec

These directories are often writable by users and should be restricted from executing or creating device files.
Each audio file will be named: audio_<language>.mp3

Every upload should replace the existing audio for that language while keeping old versions via S3 versioning.

Sumit as we had earlier discussion with Ram , He told us that Devops team will come up with a solution that every time when we refreshes the audio in s3 bucket, The CDN should serve the new refreshed audio link.
