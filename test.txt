1. TECHNICAL GOALS
Improve Deployment Automation

Built extensive automation across deployments by creating fully automated pipelines for DynamoDB operations including table creation, schema evolution, GSI updates, capacity mode switching, auto-scaling configurations, and CNR updates — reducing manual effort by 90% and improving provisioning time from hours to minutes.

Automated service onboarding and Coralogix observability workflows (log routing, dashboards, alerts, version upgrades), reducing onboarding time from 2 hours to under 10 minutes and ensuring faster, more predictable deployments.

Will continue improving automation coverage to help the team achieve 95% automated deployments and further reduce manual intervention across release processes.

Enhance System Reliability

Supported zero-downtime releases during on-call, ensuring smooth deployment of multiple production changes without customer impact.

Strengthened system reliability by resolving high-severity production issues such as memory leaks, key rotations, and emergency hotfixes.

Implemented log optimization and structured logging via Coralogix pipelines, contributing to a more proactive monitoring approach.

Will continue improving alerting, observability, and infra consistency to maintain 99.9% uptime for critical services.

Optimize Incident Response

Significantly improved operational efficiency during incidents by automating multiple parts of DB updates and observability routing, reducing dependency on manual interventions.

Led or supported emergency fixes during on-call windows, ensuring minimal downtime.

Will continue driving faster recovery during incidents by enhancing runbooks, improving debugging visibility, and contributing to a 20% reduction in MTTR.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Adoption

Standardized onboarding templates and automated infra creation workflows for new services, enabling predictable and consistent deployments.

Ensured version-controlled changes through infrastructure pipelines and consistent deployment patterns.

Will continue expanding IaC adoption across more components to help the team reach 80% coverage using Terraform/Helm.

2. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE GOALS
Strengthen Security Posture

Performed periodic IAM and SES key rotations across prod and non-prod, eliminating static credentials and improving platform security.

Ensured all certificates, CloudFront/ALB configurations, and domain updates were done with proper SSL/TLS enforcement during the banking domain migration.

Will continue improving TLS enforcement, enhancing certificate rotation workflows, and contributing toward quarterly vulnerability scans and remediation.

Compliance Readiness

Ensured audit-friendly processes during domain migration, infra updates, and automated pipelines.

Maintained structured documentation around migration steps, deployments, and infra changes to improve audit readiness.

Will continue supporting RBAC improvements and creating audit-ready documentation for all production-impacting changes.

3. PERFORMANCE & SCALABILITY GOALS
Optimize Resource Utilization

Reduced CloudWatch logging cost by 60%+ through structured logging, noise reduction, and Coralogix optimization.

Automated API Gateway logging disablement pipeline, cutting unnecessary cost associated with debug logs on high-traffic paths.

Optimized DB provisioning workflows via dynamic scaling logic, improving both performance and cost efficiency.

Will continue contributing to AWS cost reduction efforts with dynamic provisioning and performance benchmarking.

Capacity Planning

Ensured infra readiness and scaling alignment during onboarding of new workflows and services.

Standardized observability and infra requirements to ensure smooth scaling as new features/services are introduced.

Will continue contributing to capacity forecasting and preparing scaling strategies for upcoming business workloads.

4. COLLABORATION & PROCESS GOALS
Improve Communication

Ensured all deployment changes were communicated clearly with stakeholders during on-call and production releases.

Documented critical modifications (domain migration steps, infra onboarding patterns, logging standards) to improve team understanding and reduce knowledge gaps.

Will continue leading knowledge-sharing discussions and cross-team updates to improve visibility and alignment.

RACI Matrix Implementation

Ensured clear ownership during migration tasks, deployments, and on-call activities by coordinating with development, observability, and infra teams.

Standardized onboarding and logging processes that help define responsibilities across teams.

Will continue supporting better RACI alignment for major initiatives like CloudAcqui, Cloudflare optimization, and onboarding automation.
