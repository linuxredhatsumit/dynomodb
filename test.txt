Drawbacks of LVM for /tmp

Unnecessary overhead

LVM introduces extra layers (Physical Volume → Volume Group → Logical Volume).

More steps to configure, monitor, and maintain.

Potential for fragmentation / wasted space

If you dedicate a small LVM logical volume to /tmp and usage spikes, you might hit space issues.

If you oversize it, you waste space.

Recovery complexity

Troubleshooting /tmp in single-user or rescue mode is simpler with a plain partition.

With LVM, you may need to activate the volume group first (vgchange -ay), which complicates recovery.

Cloud/VM environments don’t need it

In AWS, Azure, GCP, or VMs, you can just attach a small EBS/disk and mount /tmp.

LVM’s dynamic resizing benefits aren’t usually needed for /tmp.
