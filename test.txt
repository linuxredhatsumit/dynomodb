Subject: Action Required â€“ AWS Access Key Rotation

Dear <Name>,

As part of our AWS security compliance, we have identified a few IAM access keys that are either unused or older than 90 days.
To maintain security best practices, we need to rotate these keys.

If you are aware of these keys, please confirm which ones are currently in use so I can share a new key with you for update and then deactivate the old one.
If you are not aware of these keys, please help me identify who might be using them.

Please respond at the earliest to avoid any service interruptions.
