Implement performance benchmarking for critical services.

Capacity Planning

Forecast resource needs for next 6 months and prepare scaling strategy.

✅ Collaboration & Process Goals
Improve Communication

Document all major changes and share with stakeholders before implementation.

Conduct quarterly knowledge-sharing sessions with development teams.

RACI Matrix Implementation

Define clear roles and responsibilities for all major projects (e.g., CloudAcqui).

Ensure 100% adherence to RACI in project governance.



above is my manger given the bullet points, can u check if below part can be added as per above suggestion

1. Deployment Automation & Service Onboarding
 
Designed and implemented fully automated DynamoDB pipelines for table creation, GSI updates, capacity mode switching (Provisioned ↔ On-Demand), and auto-scaling policies, reducing provisioning time.
 
Onboarded services including Motor-Insurance, VerifyPlus, Re-KYC, FinBridge, and DDLM.
 
 
Automated Coralogix integration pipelines for observability, leveraging dependency-based orchestration for version updates and alert setup.
 
 
2. Domain Migration
 
Migration of kotak811.com → kotak811.bank.in for, managing SAN certificate creation/import, ACM updates, CloudFront/ALB certificate replacement, CORS changes, CNAME cutover, header updates, and Cloudflare configuration with zero customer impact and full regulatory compliance.
 
 
3. Reliability & Production Delivery
 
Executed 100+ zero-downtime production deployments (CMR/ECMR) for critical services (Auth & User, Transaction, Reward-Journey, IIP, Acqui, BRE, Charging, Nudge, VerifyPlus).

Resolved emergency incidents (memory leaks, AWS key switch-overs, hotfixes), maintaining 99.99%+ service availability.
 
 
4. Security & Compliance
 
Led periodic IAM and SES key rotation across prod/non-prod environments, eliminating static credentials and reducing attack surface.
 
 
5. Observability & Cost Optimization
 
Optimized logging across high-volume services (Auth & User, Transaction, Reward-Journey, Nudge), removing unnecessary warnings and implementing structured parsing, reducing log volume by 60%+ and lowering CloudWatch costs.
 
Automated API Gateway logging disablement pipeline, significantly reducing operational costs.
 
1. Coralogix Observability Automation
Earlier State: Manual onboarding, inconsistent log routing, delayed debugging
After My Contribution:
Automated:
Service onboarding via CI/CD pipelines
Log routing, dashboard creation, and alert setup
orchestration for version updates
Impact:
Reduced onboarding time from 2 hours to <10 minutes
Standardized observability across 100% of new services
2- Production Deployments (CMRs & ECMRs)
Deployments across all major services, including:
KYC Transaction Service
KYC DDLm
Verify-Plus (KYC Verification)
KYC Product IIT Release
CC Application Service
CC Management Service
Transactions Service
DDLM Service
Payment Layer Services
Notification Layer Services
Auth & User Service
Reward-Journey Service
IIP Service
Acqui Service
BRE Service
Charging Service
Nudge Service
Motor-Insurance Service
FinBridge Service
Re-KYC Service
3. DynamoDB Operational Automation
Before: Manual DB updates, high risk of human error, slow provisioning
After My Contribution:
Automated:
Table creation & schema evolution
GSI updates & capacity mode switching (Provisioned ↔ On-Demand)
Auto-scaling policies
CNR updates & field corrections
Integrated cost optimization logic for dynamic provisioning
Impact:
Reduced manual intervention by 90%
Improved provisioning speed from hours to minutes
4. Infra Onboarding for New Services
Delivered infra readiness for:
Transactions Infra
DDLM Infra
Observability Integration (Coralogix)
5. Domain Migration
Led migration from kotak811.com / kotak811a.com → kotak811bank.in:
Managed CloudFront configuration, DNS routing, SSL certificates, CORS updates, redirects, and validation
Worked on Cloudflare for WAF and traffic control
6. Reliability & Incident Management
Resolved critical incidents:
Worked on compliance  to fix the findings. 
7. Security & Compliance
Led periodic IAM and SES key rotation across prod/non-prod environments
Eliminated static credentials, reducing attack surface and improving compliance posture.
8. Observability & Cost Optimization
Optimized logging across high-volume services:
Removed unnecessary warnings and implemented structured parsing (Coralogix)
Automated API Gateway logging disablement pipeline, further reducing costs.
9- Deployment Automation & Service Onboarding
Expand automation for DynamoDB ops, observability routing, and service onboarding
Goal: Reduce onboarding time from hours to minutes
10- Cloudflare Enhancements
Work on WAF, redirect rules, traffic control, edge performance
Goal: Strengthen edge security & reliability
11-  New Acqui Services
Standardize onboarding with charts and pipelines
12- Continuous Infra & Observability Improvements
Ensure predictable, fast, and secure deployments
 
 alos one more suggestion we got
Point 9 , 3 can be part of automation 
2,6 can be part of single goal
1,12, 8 can be part of single goal, Observability and Stability
