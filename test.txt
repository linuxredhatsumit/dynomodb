CIS Benchmark – Secure Mount Options

Below are the mount points and their corresponding recommended options:

Mount Point	Recommended Mount Options	Why
/tmp	nodev,nosuid,noexec	Prevents device files, privilege escalation, and binary execution
/var/tmp	nodev,nosuid,noexec	Same as /tmp — often symlinked or bind-mounted
/home	nodev	Users don’t need to create device files
/dev/shm	nodev,nosuid,noexec	Shared memory segment — should be tightly restricted
/var	nodev (optional)	Optional, but good for limiting device files in /var
/boot	nodev,nosuid	No device files, and no SUID binaries; noexec sometimes used
/ (root)	defaults	Base system mount — default options usually suffice
Removable Media (/media, /mnt)	nodev,nosuid,noexec	If automounted, apply hardening or disable automounting
/proc	hidepid=2 (extra security)	Hides other users’ processes from ps, top, etc.
